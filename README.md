Facilitating Research

# Description
For students who are finishing off their undergraduate degrees, the number of graduate programs they can undertake is daunting and often hard to find without word of mouth. Professors or researchers also have limited opportunities to find collaborators due to a limited number of available conferences and the costs to attend them. There is a trend to create more open-source and accessible information, and we would like to further explore this concept.

Our goal is to provide researchers and students an easier time to find collaborators or supervisors. To accomplish this, we want to create a database with graduate programs from around the world based on their subject areas, and a profile of supervisors/researchers. By searching a particular subject area, a student can look at various programs, and researchers can find collaborators related to that field. These programs can also be expanded into internships and postgraduate programs.

# Solution Features
1.  Design and create said database.
2.  Algorithm that will extract specific information about programs.
and supervisors.
3. Website that:
    - Easy to search
    Find list of opportunities catered to your goals.
    - Large database
    Find more options

# Languages and tool
1. Experience with SQL or databases.
2. Python.
3. HTML script for website development.
4. Interest in academia and/or database development.
